/* 
flex: 1 — tells the wrapper to grow and fill all remaining vertical space in the card. Without it, the div only takes the chart's natural 
(intrinsic) height, which is too tall.

min-height: 0 — This is the critical one. Flex children default to min-height: auto, which means they refuse to shrink smaller than their 
content. The chart's intrinsic height is larger than the available space, so without this override, the wrapper can't shrink to fit 
— it overflows instead. Setting it to 0 says "you're allowed to be smaller than your content.
*/

/* 
flex is shorthand for three properties: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis

flex: <grow> <shrink> <basis>
flex-grow — How much of the extra space this item should take. 0 = don't grow, 1 = take available space.
flex-shrink — How much this item should shrink when space is tight. 0 = don't shrink, 1 = shrink proportionally.
flex-basis — The starting size before growing/shrinking. Like setting an initial width/height.
Common values:

Shorthand	    Expands to	Meaning
flex: 1	        1 1 0	    Start at 0, grow to fill space, can shrink
flex: 0 1 auto	0 1 auto	Start at content size, don't grow, can shrink (this is the default)
flex: none	    0 0 auto	Start at content size, don't grow, don't shrink (rigid)
flex: auto	    1 1 auto	Start at content size, grow and shrink
In your case, flex: 1 (= 1 1 0) means: "start at zero height, then grow to fill whatever space is left after the title, percentage text, and progress bar are laid out." That's why the chart fits perfectly in the remaining space.
